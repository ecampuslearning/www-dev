## Features
* Dockerfile in devcontainer support
* Following attributes in devcontainer.json support
  * name
  * build
  * runArgs
  * workspaceMount
  * workspaceFolder
  * settings
  * extensions
  * forwardPorts
  * portsAttributes
  * postCraeteCommand
  * remoteUser
* SettingsSync extension support partially
  * Only downloading is supported. Uploading is not supported.
  * Synchronization of settings is done at container building time.

## Settings Sync support
`code-code-server` only supports shanalikhan's [code-settings-sync](https://github.com/shanalikhan/code-settings-sync) extension partially. 
This means that `code-code-server` doesn't support vscode builtin SettingsSync feature. And our integration with `code-settings-sync` is not perfect.

### How to use
Set your Gist ID of cloudSettings which is created by `code-settings-sync` to an Environment Variable whose name is  `SETTINGS_SYNC_GIST_ID`.
