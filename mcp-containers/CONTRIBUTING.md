# Contributing Guide

First off — thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!  
We welcome contributions from everyone and truly appreciate your help in improving our MCP container system or adding new MCP containers.

## What Can You Contribute?

Most contributors want to **add a new MCP server**, and we've made that super easy using a script in the `scripts/add-server` directory.
You may also contribute other things.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, please make sure you have the following installed:

- [**Bun**](https://bun.sh/) — A fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime
- [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) — Used to build and run containerized environments
- [**Nixpacks**](https://nixpacks.com/docs/install) — Used to generate and build container images without needing Dockerfiles

Make sure `docker` and `nixpacks` are accessible from your command line after installation.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get your environment ready and contribute:

1. **Fork this repository**  
   Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repo page to create your own copy.

2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git
   cd REPO-NAME
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

4. **Run the add-server script**
   ```bash
   bun add-server
   ```

5. **Follow the interactive prompts** to configure and create your new MCP server.
   1. Make sure to check the server manifest when prompted.
   2. The `add-server` script will run a test build to ensure everything is set up correctly.
   3. If you encounter any issues during the build, please ensure to fix them before proceeding.

6. **Verify your addition**  
   Check the `catalog/` directory — your new server config should be listed there.

## Before You Submit

1. Make sure your code follows any existing conventions and structure.
2. Double-check that your server shows up correctly in the `catalog/` folder.
3. Run the build and fix any errors or warnings.
4. Commit your changes with a clear message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new MCP server: <name>"
   ```
5. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
