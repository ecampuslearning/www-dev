> Repository: [liuyoshio/mcp-compass](https://github.com/liuyoshio/mcp-compass)

## Description

MCP Discovery & Recommendation Service - Find the right MCP server for your needs


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--liuyoshio--mcp-compass--mcp-compass
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \ 
ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--liuyoshio--mcp-compass--mcp-compass  "node ./build/index.js"
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-i` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
