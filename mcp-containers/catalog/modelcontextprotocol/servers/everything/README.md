# Everything MCP Server

A containerized version of "Everything MCP Server"

> Repository: [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)

## Description

This MCP server attempts to exercise all the features of the MCP protocol. It is not intended to be a useful server, but rather a test server for builders of MCP clients. It implements prompts, tools, resources, sampling, and more to showcase MCP capabilities.


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--modelcontextprotocol--servers--everything
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \ 
ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--modelcontextprotocol--servers--everything  "cd ./src/everything && node ./dist/index.js"
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-i` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
