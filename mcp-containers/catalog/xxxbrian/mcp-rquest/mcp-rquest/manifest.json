  "description": "A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides advanced HTTP request capabilities for Claude and other LLMs. Built on [rquest](https://github.com/0x676e67/rquest), this server enables realistic browser emulation with accurate TLS/JA3/JA4 fingerprints, allowing models to interact with websites more naturally and bypass common anti-bot measures. It also supports converting PDF and HTML documents to Markdown for easier processing by LLMs."
